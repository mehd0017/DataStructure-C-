-this repository contains two files in Data Structure in C language.

-In the hashqueue file, the queue is created using a hash table where all the processes that has the same priority are placed in a linked list in the apropriate index in the hash table.

-In the Tablequeue file, the queue is created using a regular priority queue structure and all the processes are sorted according to the priorities. the processes with the same priority are placed according to FIFO.
